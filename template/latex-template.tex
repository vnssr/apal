\question{1}{Mathematical Symbols}

This is an example of an answer to a homework question.  In your
answer, you may want to use a variety of mathematical symbols:

% this is one way to make a list. Another would be to say
% \begin{enumerate} and \end{enumerate}, which would give numbers instead
% of bullets to the items
\begin{itemize}
\item Fractions: $\frac{2}{3}$ %don't need curly braces for single chars; could have typed \frac23
\item Binomial coefficients: $\binom{n}{k} = 10$
\item Subscripts and superscripts: $t_0$, $t^2$, $t_0^{2/3}$, 
\item Greek letters: $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\lambda$, $\Pi$, $\pi$.
\item Summations: $\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}2$.
\end{itemize}

You can refer to Leslie Lamport's ``\LaTeX\ User's Guide and
Reference Manual'' for more useful info on mathematical typesetting
with \LaTeX.  Pages 42--46 outline many of the useful math symbols
and functions.



\question{2}{Little Gauss's Formula}

This is another example of a question.  In this case, it's
a multi-part question.

\part{a} Recall \emph{Little Gauss's formula}:

% equations are automatically centered!
\begin{align}
\sum_{i=1}^n i = {\frac{n(n+1)}2}  % as usual, liberal use of curly braces...
\label{little-gauss}        % labelled so we can refer to this formula by number
\end{align}

\part{b} Now, equation~\ref{little-gauss} can be proven by induction as
follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Base case}: $n=1$: $1 = 1(2)/2=1$.
\item \textbf{Inductive hypothesis}: assume the equation holds for $n=2...k$.
\item \textbf{Inductive step}: for $n=k+1$, we have
\begin{align*}    % the star suppresses the equation numbers 
\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i = (k+1) + \sum_{i=1}^k i
\end{align*}
Using the inductive hypothesis, we can substitute for the second term
on the righthand side:
\begin{align*}
  \sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i &= (k+1) + k(k+1)/2\\    
                   &= {\frac{{2k+2 + k(k+1)}}2}\\
                   &= {\frac{{k^2 + 3k + 2}}2}\\
                   &= {\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}2}
\end{align*}
% notice \\ to indicate newline and the &=& to line up the equals signs 
\end{itemize}

Lo and behold! The last line shows that for $n=k+1$, little Gauss'
formula still holds for $n=k+1$! We've showed that the formula holds
for $n=1$, and we've shown that if it holds for $n=k$ it must hold for
$n=k+1$. Therefore, it must hold for all $n$.
